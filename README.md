# Austin Sierra Test Submission
This project involved debugging an existing login system and implementing a RESTful API for managing meetings. Although the task took longer than the estimated time (about 4 hours) due to additional debugging and optimization, I ensured that the code is clean, optimized, and adheres to best practices for scalability and maintainability.

The primary changes can be found here:
client\src\views\admin\meeting\components\Addmeeting.js

server\controllers\meeting\_routes.js

## Challenges and Time Extensions
While the task was initially estimated to take 1 hour, I spent additional time addressing the following:
### Debugging: 
I faced some issues related to the environment setup and ensuring proper login functionality, which required additional debugging.
### Code Optimization: 
To make the code more efficient, I spent extra time optimizing the API routes and ensuring best practices for scalability.
### Bugs and Spelling: 
There are lots of other bugs (firefox compatibility, custom contact model) and spelling issues which made it confusing at certain points.
### Lunch Break: 
I stopped to make some lunch. Twas excellent.
I prioritized clean, maintainable code and effective error handling; triple checking my work, which resulted in more time spent than initially anticipated.
